## exp1.py

1) produce precision values i.e. mse_ols/mse_ridge by running simulations.

## exp2.py

1) using variance and bias derivations to compute precision. (as error is generated from N(0,1), var(y) is taken 
to be equal to 1)

2) precision is calculated using var(y)= mae and var(y)=var(train y)

## exp3.py

1) Newton raphson was used to optimize betas and lambda at the same time.

2) bias and variance were calculated using formulas

3) var(e)=var(ytrain)

## exp4.py

1) Newton raphson was used to compute optimal lambda

2) bias and variance are calculated using formulas.

3) var(e)=var(ytrain)
